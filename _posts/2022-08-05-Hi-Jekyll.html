<p>I was looking into ways to display my work and build a site for myself and I came across Jekyll. I've been pleasantly surprised 
    to find how smooth building a site has been so far!</p>

<p>It's been fun reminding myself of the HTML and CSS elements that I hadn't used in several years to construct this as well as learning a fair bit of 
    new things. I'm currently trying to find ways to best incorporate and show Jupyter notebooks containing my Python projects.</p>

<p>Here are a few resources that I used to build my website:</p>
