<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">I was looking into ways to display my work and build a site for myself and I came across Jekyll. I've been pleasantly surprised 
    to find how smooth building a site has been so far!</p>

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">It's been fun reminding myself of the HTML and CSS elements that I hadn't used in several years to construct this as well as learning a fair bit of 
    new things. I'm currently trying to find ways to best incorporate and show Jupyter notebooks containing my Python projects.</p>

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">Here are a few resources that I used to build my website:</p>

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">One of the things I need to figure out still is how to make my site more mobile friendly. I found this nice tutorial online that I'll try to implement as soon as I 
    get the chance. Here's the link to the tutorial <a href="https://nicolashery.com/fast-mobile-friendly-website-with-jekyll/">https://nicolashery.com/fast-mobile-friendly-website-with-jekyll/
