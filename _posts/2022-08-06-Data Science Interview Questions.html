<p>This post will serve as a compilation of interview questions with answers that I've found as I prepared for data science interviews.</p>

1. What is Data Science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements from scientific processes, mathematics, and programming to extract, process, 
and visualize information from data that can be used to aid in a variety of scenarios. In other words, data science means analysing data for 
actionable insights.


2. What are the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning?
In supervised learning, the nature of the data is known, the data is labeled, and there is a feedback loop mechanism associated with it. Examples of 
supervised learning algorithms are decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machine

In unsupervised learning, the data isn't labeled and there is no feedback loop mechanism. Examples of supervised learning algorithms are 
k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and apriori algorithms.

3. How is logistic regression done?
Logistic regression measures the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probability 
using its underlying logistic function. The sigmoid is the logistic function used for logistic regression.

Logistic regression is used both for regression and classification tasks. If used for classification tasks then classification needs to be binary.
