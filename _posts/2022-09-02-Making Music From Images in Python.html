<p>To say that music is an integral component in my life is a massive understatement. I've been a guitar player for over 20 years and not a day 
    goes by where I don't listen to it. As a matter of fact, before embarking in my academic journey as a physical chemist over the past 12 years
    I was on the brink of pursuing a career in music.</p>
    
<p>Though, I wasn't able to pursue that path, I am still able to enjoy music and do cool things with it and through it. For instance, in this project,
    I thought it'd be cool to make a program that could make music from images. There have been some pretty neat attempts to generate such a thing in the 
    past, however, the results are not quite ... musical ... </p>

<p>For the remainder of this article I'll be showing my attempt at generating songs from images that are (in my humble opinion) pretty cool sounding
    if I say so myself.</p>

<h2>The Basic Idea</h2>

<p>My strategy and thought process to accomplish this is as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Images are made of pixels</li>
    <li>Pixels are composed of arrays of numbers that designate color</li>
    <li>Color is described via color spaces like RGB or HSV</li>
    <li>The color space could be partitioned into sections</li>
    <li>Musical scales are subdivided into notes via sound intervals</li>
    <li>Sound is vibration and so each note is associated with a frequency</li>
    <li>Therefore, the subdivision of a color space could be mapped to a specific note in a musical scale. This note would then have a 
        frequency associated with it. </li>
</ul>

<p>Let's give it a go!</p>

<h2>Using the HSV Color Space</h2>

<p>HSV is color space that is controlled by 3 values. The 3 values are Hue, Saturation, and Brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7V12.png" width = 300 height = 500></p>

<p>Hue is defined as "the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet". In other words, Hue represents color.</p>

<p>Saturation is defined as "colorfulness of an area judged in proportion to its brightness". In other words, Saturation represents the amount to which a color is mixed with white.</p>

<p>Brightness is defined as "perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target". In other words, Saturation represents the amount to which a color is mixed with black.</p>

<p>Hue values of basic colors:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Orange  0-44</li>
        <li>Yellow  44- 76</li>
        <li>Green   76-150</li>
        <li>Blue    150-260</li>
        <li>Violet  260-320</li>
        <li>Red     320-360</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll work in HSV color space because it already is naturally subdivided which makes the subsequent frequency mapping a bit more intuitive
    and the hue channel (which is mostly reponsible for color in this space) is defused from the other two channels which simplifies things.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a comparison between color spaces for an image I found online</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/90cfdafe49a355c9dfe9c2bb54686db8.js"></script>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src = "\img\posts\Music From Images\color spaces.png"></p>

<h2>Extracting the Hue channel</h2>

<p>Now that we have our image in HSV, let's extract the hue (H) value from every pixel. This can be done via a nested for loop over the 
    height and width of the image.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/41187de45fd0da33312eea63ce308460.js"></script>

<p>Now that I have an array containing the H value for each pixel, I'll place that result into a pandas dataframe. Each row in the dataframe 
    is a pixel and thus each column will contain information about that pixel. I'll call this dataframe <code>pixels_df</code> which can be seen below.</p>
    
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="\img\posts\Music From Images\pixels df.JPG" width = 400 height = 700></p>

<p>The dataframe is currently composed of a single column called 'hues' where each row represents the H-channel for each pixel on the image I loaded.</p>

<h2>Converting hues to frequencies</h2>
<p>My initial idea at converting a hue value into a frequency involved a mapping between a predetermined set of frequencies to the H value. 
    The mapping function is shown below. </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/e37cd36a8b4cb1b7762373d3f38ca881.js"></script>

<p>The function takes the H value and an array containing frequencies to map H to as inputs. The example uses an array called <code>scale_freqs</code>
    to define the frequencies. The frequencies used in <code>scale_freqs</code> correspond to the A Harmonic Minor Scale.</p> 

<p>Then, an array of threshold values (called <code>thresholds</code>) for H is defined. This array of thresholds 
    can then be used to convert H into a frequency from  <code>scale_freqs</code> using a lammbda function. </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/8c241c8bb0631438384578360f85d17d.js"></script>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="\img\posts\Music From Images\pixels df 2.JPG"></p>

<h2>Converting NumPy Array into Playable Audio</h2>
<p>Cool! Now, that I have an array of frequencies, I'll convert the <code>notes</code> column into a numpy array called <code>frequencies</code> 
    since I can then use this to make a playable audio file :] To do this I can use the <code>wavfile.write</code> function that is built in 
scipy and make sure that I use the appropriate data type conversion (for 1D arrays it is np.float32).</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/797fe458e5a5415eee844a072d5d7bc5.js"></script>

<p>You can hear the song that I made using the first 60 pixels from the image below (I could try using all of the 230,400 pixels that make up that image
     but that song would end up being several hours long). </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><audio controls src="\img\posts\Music From Images\ini_song.wav">

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src = "\img\posts\Music From Images\colors.jpg"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Song 1 - Also known as the song that came before Blur's hit song from 1997 Song 2</p>

<p>That's pretty neat! Let me play with it a bit more. </p>

<h2>Including Octaves</h2>

<p>I decided to include the effect of octaves (i.e., make notes sound higher or lower) into my
     'song-making' routine. The octave to be used for a given note will be chosen at random from an array.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/d8c43d3738fb6658856c8af522ad319b.js"></script>

<p>Let's give it a listen!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><audio style="text-align:center;" controls src="\img\posts\Music From Images\octave_song.wav">

<p style="text-align:center;">Song of Octaves (the lesser known cousin of Song of Storms)</p>

<p>Awesome! Now we are getting some variety. However... We do have all these pixels, how about we try using them by picking the frequencies 
    from random pixels?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Calcucore</p>

<p>Sweet! We now basically have a song generator that we can play around with for as long as we wish!</p>

<p>I know it's a bit of a meme, but "Is this math rock?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src = "https://i.redd.it/t5t0pu14pcl61.jpg"></p>

<h2>Generating Other Scales</h2>

<p>So far I've shown how music can be generated from images using the A-Harmonic Minor Scale. As cool as this scale is, it would be nice to be able 
    to get more variety not only in terms of the starting note (the tonic) of our scale, but also be able to include other intervals besides those
    defined by the harmonic minor scale structure. This will allow our program to add a lot more flavor and variety to the generated songs.</p>

<p>To do this, I first needed a way to procedurally generate frequencies for whatever tonic note we wish to use. Katie He has a wonderful article 
    found <a href = "https://towardsdatascience.com/music-in-python-2f054deb41f4">here</a> that has a really neat exploration of python and music. I 
    adapted one of her functions in my work to map piano notes to frequencies as shown below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/abefa6eec9e940e3a4c5873e75310572.js"></script>

<p>The function above will serve as the starting point for my song/scale generating routine can be used to generate a dictionary that maps musical
    notes corresponding to the 88 keys in a standard piano to frequencies in units of Hertz as shown below.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/2a68dedbc2dc69fdc705e73d5b9dde50.js"></script>

<p>Then we need to define the scale intervals in terms of tones so that we can index out notes.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/0732278cae628421e46e37b2a18af183.js"></script>

<p>Having this, we can now find the index of our scale in the list of tones from before. This is needed because I'll then reindex the list so 
    that it starts with our desired tonic</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/f8d7c287963e11ae7be4fd04bdfa7264.js"></script>

<p>After this, I can define a bunch of different scale arrays where each element corresponds to an index from the reindex array I made in the previous 
    step.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/d946d65217a15eeb16b64b64aea5a928.js"></script>

<p>Almost ready! I'll also define intervals to use here in case I want to make harmonies for the songs we make.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/cc46697d368fb8feebb042a1fa2d612e.js"></script>

<p>And now I can take the results from the previous steps and make a song!</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/304ccb5164f4a7ba3b862f5d35a8572c.js"></script>

<p>Let's test it out on a few images!</p>

<h2>Including harmony in songs through 2D NumPy arrays</h2>
<p>The routine I developed allows harmony to be added to our song. The user can define what harmony to use (i.e., perfect fifth, minor 6th, etc.)
    and then the correct note interval is deduced from that using the routines I showed earlier. Below I'll show an example of the song made from 
    an image, the corresponding harmony and both of them put together into a single .wav file via a 2D numpy array. </p>

<p>From the documentation for scipy.io.wavfile.write, if I want to write a 2D array into a .wav file, the 2D array must be have dimensions in the 
    form of (Nsamples, Nchannels). Notice how the shape of our array is currently (2, 264600). This means we have Nchannels = 2 and 
    Nsamples = 264600. To ensure our numpy array has the correct shape for scipy.io.wavfile.write I'll transpose the array first.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Nature Song -  Made using A# Harmonic Minor, the 2nd Octave range, and minor 3rd harmony.</p>

<h2>Adding Effects to Our Music with Pedalboard</h2>

<p>Now I'm going to load the .wav files and do some extra manipulation on it using the pedalboard module from Spotify which is awesome. 
You can read more about the pedalboard library <a href = "https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard">here</a> and 
<a href = "https://spotify.github.io/pedalboard/reference/pedalboard.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Using Librosa For Mapping Other Musical Quantities</h2>

<p>Librosa is a wonderful package that allows one to carry out a variety of operations on sound data. 
    Here I used it to readily convert frequencies into 'Notes' and 'Midi Numbers'.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/fd7ec2919c4509ef2b75a3dba93a1c85.js"></script>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src = "\img\posts\Music From Images\catterina_df_1.JPG"></p>

<h2>Making a MIDI from our Song</h2>

<p>Now that I've generated a dataframe containing frequencies, notes and midi numbers I can make a midi file out of it! I could then use this 
    MIDI file to generate sheet music for our song :]</p>

<p>To make a MIDI file, I'll make use of the <code>midiutil</code> package. This package allows us to build MIDI files from an array of MIDI numbers. 
    You can configure your file in a variety of ways by setting up volume, tempos and tracks. For now, I'll just make a single track midi file</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/victormurcia/0d51982ea2a7f9c220cf9b3faac702d6.js"></script>   

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I showed how music can be made from images and how our songs can be exported into .wav files for subsequent processing. 
There's tons of experimentation that can be done with this. I had fun making this project and I hope you have using it and building upon it!</p>
