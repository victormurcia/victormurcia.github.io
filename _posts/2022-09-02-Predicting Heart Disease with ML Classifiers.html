In this post I'll be showing how machine learning models can be trained and used to predict heart disease. The dataset I'll be using here is the 
Heart Disease Dataset that I extracted from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository found here: <a href = "https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease">https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease</a>. 
This dataset contains databases from Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and the VA Long Beach with each containing 76 different attributes of 
categorical and numerical types. This data was collected by the following institutions back in 1988:

1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest
2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland
3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland
4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation

<h2>Motivation for Studying Heart Disease</h2>
The accurate prediction and diagnosis of diseases is at the forefront of challenges that need to be addressed by medical professionals. 
This is a complicated task due to the myriad of factors that can contribute towards an ailment. In the United States, heart disease is the 
leading cause of death in the population with 696,962 deaths reported in 2021 (1 in every 5 deaths). <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/heart-disease.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/heart-disease.htm</a>. 
As such, it is imperative to understand the causes and factors that lead to this deadly disease.
