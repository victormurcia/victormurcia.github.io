<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">Hi everyone, my name is Victor Murcia and I am  a scientist that is profoundly interested in extracting information and patterns from all sorts of data forms. 

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">I have a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering (August 2022) from Washington State University where I specialized in Computational Physics/Chemistry. My research
    focused on developing clustering algorithms and tensor-based mathematical models for the extraction of molecular orientation in systems targeted for a variety of 
    carbon-based technologies (i.e., solar cells, transistors, LEDs, biosensors, and many others).</p>
 
<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">I also have a B.S. in Chemistry (May 2014) from the Rochester Institute of Technology with minors in Mathematics and Philosophy.</p>

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">This blog will serve as a bit of a journal where I can display some of the projects I've worked on as well as detail some of the things I've learned and/or am currently learning.</p>

<p style="color:#F2F4F3;">Feel free to reach out to me via one of the methods below!</p>
